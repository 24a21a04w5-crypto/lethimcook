## 🚀 About

Let Him Cook is a revolutionary platform that makes starting a company as easy as creating a GitHub repository. We combine cofounder matching, automated legal document generation, and investor connections into one seamless experience.

### The Problem

- **Finding cofounders** takes 6+ months
- **Legal paperwork** costs $5,000-$10,000
- **Connecting with investors** is nearly impossible for first-timers
- **99% of startup ideas** never get past the ideation phase

### The Solution

Let Him Cook transforms company formation from a 6-month, $10,000 process into 48 hours at $0 upfront.

1. **Post Your Idea** - Share your startup vision
2. **Get "Pull Requests"** - Talented cofounders request to join (like GitHub PRs)
3. **Auto-Generate Legal Docs** - Incorporation, founder agreements, IP assignments
4. **Connect With Investors** - Get featured to our angel network
